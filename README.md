## SearchMyStuff


</div>

### Description

Over the years, I've accumulated a lot of code resources.

However, it's gotten scattered into many locations

on my box's local drives and external drives. So I wrote

these two projects in an effort to organize my code

into a searchable database for ease in finding reusable

code. The first project is BuildMyStuff, which will

scan recursively from the path you specify to accumulate

the types of files you want into an MS Access database--

you do NOT need Access installed to use these projects,

see comments below**. The second project is SearchMyStuff,

which will allow you to type in a search word/phrase

which will return results based on finding the search

criteria in the file's name or text. Once you have

a list of files, you can view them (copy/paste), move

them to a new location, drag them into an open VB

Project Window, or remove them from the Database (you

will likely come up with a lot of duplication, as I did.

I have included an empty database, Ref.mdb. Hoping that

it makes it through the screening process. If not

I will submit a modification that builds it via code.

**(If you have MS Access installed you can skip this.)

About the Database: I use DAO almost exclusively (I know

that ADO has many more bells &amp; whistles, but for a desktop

app, DAO is simply easier to use and faster). At any

rate, if BuildMyStuff loads without any missing

references, you are good to go. Otherwise you will

need to locate dao360.dll on your machine, or download it,

and register it (Start|Run|regsvr32.exe c:\[path]\dao360.dll)

Possible Locations:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DAO\dao360.dll

C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386

For info, my version is 3.60.9512.0
